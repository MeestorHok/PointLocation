This project uses a frontend GUI and as well as text input to test it.
To test the text input, run app.TestClass. It will run the Grid class on the input.txt file included.
To test the program using a GUI, run app.UI. It will launch a frontend that users can easily use to
add lines dynamically and compare points on. The program is very self-explanatory, so you shouldn't have
any problems creating lines and comparing points.

My program contains all of the UI components in the ui package and all of the data structures, such as
a custom BST implementation and Line and Point classes, in the structures package. The Grid class is the
class that handles most of the logic necessary for the project.

All code is my own with the exception of a function (I added a comment with the source) that calculates
the intersection between two lines. Also, I used the function from the project description to decide whether
a point is on one side of a line or the other.


EXTRA CREDIT:
I believe this project deserves extra credit because of the dynamic UI I built to support testing and using
the program.
